# Airbnb Diversity and Inclusiveness Analysis
This repository contains scripts and data for analyzing diversity and inclusiveness in Airbnb user interactions. The scripts are written in R and can be used to analyze anonymized data of Airbnb users.

# Files
The repository contains the following files:
* `diversity.Rmd` This R script performs a diversity analysis on the anonymized Airbnb user data. It calculates diversity metrics, such as gender, age, and ethnicity, to understand the representation of different groups within the Airbnb community.
* `inclusion.rmd` This R script focuses on measuring inclusiveness in Airbnb user interactions. It examines the patterns of homophilic and heterophilic interactions and explores their relationship with user sentiment.
* `host_guests_reviews.csv` This CSV file contains anonymized data of Airbnb users. The data has been processed to ensure privacy and confidentiality while still enabling analysis and insights.


# Usage

-  Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   https://github.com/researchprofile/diversity-inclusive.git  
   ```
- Ensure that R and the required dependencies are installed on your system.
- Run the `diversity.Rmd` script to perform the diversity analysis on the Airbnb user data. This script will generate insights and visualizations related to the representation of different demographic groups.
- Run the `inclusion.rmd` script to analyze the inclusiveness of Airbnb user interactions. This script will provide insights into the prevalence of homophilic and heterophilic interactions and their impact on user sentiment.

Please note that the `host_guests_reviews.csv` file should be placed in the same directory as the R scripts for proper execution.
